# MTR Direct — Things You Might Not Be Thinking About

These are the "oh shit, I forgot about that" items. Not urgent, but worth having on your radar before launch.

---

## Pre-Launch Essentials

### 1. Domain Name
**Status:** Not purchased yet  
**Options available:** mtrdirect.io, mtrdirect.co, mtrhq.com, directmtr.com

**Recommendation:** Buy mtrdirect.io or mtrdirect.co this weekend. $10-15 and takes 5 minutes.

### 2. Legal Pages
**Need before collecting emails:**
- Privacy Policy (you're collecting email addresses)
- Terms of Service (basic protection)

**Quick solution:** Use a generator like Termly or GetTerms. Or I can draft basic versions.

### 3. Formspree Verification
The waitlist API sends to FormSubmit.co using your Gmail. First submission requires email confirmation. **Test it yourself** to verify you receive the notification.

## Post-Launch Considerations

### 4. Support Channel
When people sign up, they'll have questions. Options:
- Email (chadwick23.ai@gmail.com or hello@mtrdirect.io)
- Intercom/Crisp widget on site
- Just reply manually at first (fine for <100 users)

### 5. Accounting
You'll need to track:
- Revenue (Stripe when you integrate)
- Expenses (Vercel, domain, ads, etc.)
- Separate bank account recommended

**Quick solution:** Baselane or just a spreadsheet for now.

### 6. Pricing Validation
Current: $29 / $79 / $149

**Question:** Is this right?
- Too cheap? You might attract tire-kickers
- Too expensive? Friction for first customers
- Competitor Lodgify: $17-80/mo
- Value prop: Saves $500+/mo in Airbnb fees

**My take:** Pricing is fine. Don't overthink it. Can adjust later.

## Timing Considerations

### Your Calendar
- **Feb 15-16:** Marathon
- **March:** Baby #3 arriving

### Launch Window
If you want to launch before the marathon, that's this weekend (Feb 8-9).
Otherwise, wait until after the marathon (Feb 17+).

**My take:** Soft launch this weekend (waitlist + site live). No major marketing push until you have time to respond.

## Risk Mitigation

### 7. Backup Your Work
The code is on GitHub (cgood12/mtr-saas). Good.
But also backup:
- Waitlist emails (export from Vercel logs or set up a Google Sheet integration)
- Any design assets

### 8. What If It Blows Up?
If you get 1,000 signups overnight (unlikely but possible):
- Can you handle the support load?
- Is the site stable under traffic?
- Do you have a plan for onboarding?

**Reality:** You'll probably get 10-50 signups in the first week. Scale problems are good problems.

## Things I Can Help With

- Draft Privacy Policy / ToS
- Set up Google Sheet integration for waitlist
- Create onboarding email sequence
- Monitor BiggerPockets threads for mentions
- Research competitors weekly

Just say the word.
