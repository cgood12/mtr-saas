# MTR Direct — Weekend Launch Checklist

## 🔴 Chad Must Do (Can't Automate These)

### Domain & Hosting
- [ ] **Buy a domain** — suggestions: `mtrdirect.com`, `mtrdirect.io`, `bookmtr.com`, `directmtr.com`, `staynohost.com`
- [ ] **Set up DNS** — point domain to hosting (Vercel, Netlify, or Tailscale Funnel for now)
- [ ] **SSL certificate** — auto if using Vercel/Netlify/Tailscale

### Form & Email
- [x] ~~**Create Formspree account**~~ — **DONE: Built custom form handler instead!** Inquiry form now emails you directly via Gmail. No setup needed.
- [ ] **Set up email forwarding** — decide if `chadwick23.ai@gmail.com` is the right contact or get a branded email (e.g., `hello@mtrdirect.com`)

### Accounts Needed (For Full SaaS Later)
- [ ] **Stripe account** — for payment processing (https://stripe.com)
- [ ] **Facebook Business account** — for Marketing API / running ads
- [ ] **TransUnion SmartMove** or **Certn** account — for tenant screening API
- [ ] **DocuSign** or **HelloSign** account — for lease e-signatures
- [ ] **SendGrid** account — for transactional emails (free tier: 100/day)

### Content
- [ ] **Record a 60-second property walkthrough video** (iPhone is fine) — huge conversion booster
- [ ] **Take a photo of you + Michelle** at/near the property for the host bio
- [ ] **Write 2-3 sentences** about why you started MTR Direct (for the SaaS landing page founder story)

### Legal (Before Accepting Real Bookings)
- [ ] **Privacy policy** — use a generator (Termly, PrivacyPolicies.com — free)
- [ ] **Terms of service** — basic template for now
- [ ] **Lease template** — get your actual MTR lease reviewed (you already have one from Furnished Finder)
