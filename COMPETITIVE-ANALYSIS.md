# MTR Direct — Competitive Analysis
**Updated:** 2026-02-08

---

## Executive Summary

The MTR (medium-term rental) market is growing 25%+ YoY but remains **underserved by purpose-built tools**. Existing solutions fall into two camps:

1. **Listing platforms** (Furnished Finder, Homads, CHBO) — drive leads but no automation
2. **STR tools** (Hostaway, Guesty, iGMS) — built for nightly stays, awkward for 1-12 month leases

**MTR Direct's opportunity:** First end-to-end platform purpose-built for MTR hosts. From marketing → lead capture → screening → lease → payment → move-in.

## Market Landscape

### Listing Platforms (Where Hosts Advertise)

| Platform | Model | Commission | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------|------------|------|------|
| **Furnished Finder** | Annual fee ($149) | 0% | 15M users, tenant tools | No API, crowded (300K+ listings) |
| **Homads** | Free or annual plans | 3% | Family-focused, transparent | Limited to single-family homes |
| **CHBO** | Subscription | Varies | Corporate tenant focus | Niche audience |
| **Blueground** | Managed | They keep most | Zero work, guaranteed rent | Lose control + profit margin |

**Key insight:** Furnished Finder dominates but **has no software integrations** (confirmed by their team). Hosts must manually manage everything.

### Property Management Software

| Platform | Focus | Pricing | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------|-------|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Baselane** | Banking/bookkeeping | Free-$29/mo | Financial clarity, rent collection | No marketing, no booking site |
| **Hostaway** | STR channel mgmt | $99+/mo | Full-featured, integrations | Built for nightly stays |
| **Guesty** | STR/PM | $49+/mo | Enterprise-grade | Overkill for solo hosts |
| **Lodgify** | Direct booking sites | $17+/mo | Website builder | STR-focused, no MTR workflows |
| **Buildium** | Traditional PM | $58+/mo | Full PM suite | Old school, not MTR-specific |

**Key insight:** No one combines **direct booking site + marketing automation + MTR-specific workflows** in one platform.

## Competitive Positioning

### Where MTR Direct Wins

| Capability | Furnished Finder | Hostaway | Baselane | **MTR Direct** |
|------------|-----------------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Direct booking site | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Marketing engine (ads) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Tenant screening | ✅ (3rd party) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| MTR lease templates | ✅ (basic) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Payment processing | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Move-in automation | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| No platform fees | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

### Our Unfair Advantages

1. **AI-first:** Site generation, ad copy, tenant communication — all automated
2. **MTR-native:** Built for 1-12 month stays, not adapted from STR tools
3. **Marketing included:** Facebook/Instagram ads are part of the platform, not an add-on
4. **No commission model:** Flat monthly fee vs 15-20% platform cuts

## Threats

1. **Furnished Finder launches automation tools** — They have the audience
2. **Hostaway/Guesty add MTR features** — They have the infrastructure
3. **Airbnb improves MTR experience** — They have the brand
4. **Economic downturn** — MTR demand could shift
