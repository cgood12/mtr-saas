# MTR Direct — Business Plan
*"Airbnb's automation without Airbnb's fees. From ad to move-in, fully automated."*

---

## The Problem

Medium-term rental (MTR) hosts — traveling nurse properties, corporate housing, relocation rentals — are stuck between two bad options:

1. **Airbnb/VRBO** — handles everything but takes 15-20%, controls your guests, and optimizes for short stays
2. **Furnished Finder** — great lead gen for MTR specifically, but the post-inquiry process is painful: hosts buy lease templates separately, cobble together background checks, handle payments manually, and piece together 4-5 tools to close a tenant

**Nobody owns the full MTR host workflow.** Every existing tool (Lodgify, Hospitable, Guesty) is built for short-term rentals. MTR has fundamentally different needs: monthly billing, lease agreements, tenant screening, 30+ day legal requirements.

## The Solution

**MTR Direct** — an all-in-one platform for MTR hosts to attract, screen, and close tenants without platform fees.

### The Stack

| Layer | What It Does | Replaces |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Direct Booking Site** | Beautiful, SEO-optimized property page with inquiry form | Carrd + manual website |
| **Lead Management** | Inquiry dashboard, auto-responses, availability calendar | Email + spreadsheets |
| **Tenant Screening** | One-click credit + background checks | Separate services ($30-50 each) |
| **Lease Generation** | MTR-specific templates, auto-filled, e-signed | Buying templates ($50-200) |
| **Payments** | Monthly invoicing, auto-charge, security deposit handling | Venmo/Zelle/manual |
| **Move-in Automation** | Welcome guide, smart lock codes, utility info, house manual | Text messages + PDFs |
| **Marketing Engine** | Auto-generated Facebook/Instagram ads targeting nurses + relocators | Hosts doing nothing / hiring agencies ($1K+/mo) |

### Why This Wins

- **Template gets them in the door** (low friction, immediate value)
- **Operational backend keeps them** (high switching cost — their leases, payment history, guest data all live here)
- **Network effects over time** — verified guest directory, pricing data across markets

## Target Customer

**Primary:** MTR hosts on Furnished Finder who want direct bookings + less operational headache
- Traveling nurse housing hosts (largest MTR segment)
- Corporate housing providers (1-10 properties)
- Relocation rental hosts
- Snowbird/seasonal rental owners

**Profile:**
- 1-5 properties (solo operators or small portfolios)
- Currently using Furnished Finder + Airbnb + manual processes
- Tired of platform fees but don't want to lose the operational safety net
- Not technical — needs simple, done-for-you tools

## Market Opportunity

- **Furnished Finder** has 200K+ listed properties and growing fast
- **MTR is booming** — remote work, traveling healthcare, military relocations
- **No direct competitors** in the MTR-specific tooling space
- STR tools (Lodgify, Hospitable, Guesty) don't serve MTR needs (monthly billing, leases, screening)
- The "Furnished Finder to direct booking" pipeline is a massive, unserved flow

## Revenue Model

### Pricing Tiers

| Tier | Price | Includes |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Starter** | $29/mo | Direct booking site + inquiry form + availability calendar |
| **Professional** | $79/mo | Everything in Starter + lease generation + e-signatures + tenant screening (pay-per-check) |
| **Business** | $149/mo | Everything in Pro + payment processing + move-in automation + priority support |

### Additional Revenue
- **Ad spend margin** — 15-20% of host's ad budget (host spends $300/mo on ads, we keep $45-60)
- **Tenant screening fees** — pass-through + small markup ($5-10/check)
- **Payment processing** — standard 2.9% + $0.30 (Stripe, keep the margin)
- **One-time setup fee** — $97-197 for site build + onboarding
- **Annual plans** — 2 months free (improves retention + cash flow)

### The ROI Pitch
For a $4,500/mo rental, Airbnb takes ~$675-900/mo in fees. MTR Direct charges $149/mo. **Host saves $500+/mo** while getting the same hands-off automation. Pays for itself 3-4x over.

### The Full Automation Flow
1. Host signs up → answers 10 questions, uploads photos
2. AI auto-generates site (copy, SEO, template selection)
3. Ads auto-launch on Facebook/Instagram (targeting nurses + relocators in their market)
4. Lead comes in → auto-response with availability + "ready to apply?" link
5. Guest applies → screening runs automatically, host gets ✅ or ❌
6. Lease auto-generates → pre-filled, sent for e-signature
7. Payment auto-starts → first month + deposit via Stripe, recurring billing
8. Move-in packet auto-sends → lock code, welcome guide, WiFi, local recs

### Revenue Projections (Conservative)

| Milestone | Hosts | Avg MRR/Host | Total MRR |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 6 months | 50 | $55 | $2,750 |
| 12 months | 200 | $65 | $13,000 |
| 18 months | 500 | $75 | $37,500 |
| 24 months | 1,000 | $80 | $80,000 |

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Focus | MTR Support | Gap |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| **Furnished Finder** | Lead gen marketplace | Leads only | No post-inquiry tools |
| **Lodgify** | STR website + booking | Nightly rates only | No leases, screening, monthly billing |
| **Hospitable** | STR automation | Messaging + pricing | STR-focused, no MTR workflow |
| **Guesty** | Property management | Enterprise STR | Too complex, too expensive for 1-5 properties |
| **Avail (by Realtor.com)** | Long-term rentals | Lease + screening | Not MTR-specific, no booking site, ugly |
| **TurboTenant** | Long-term rentals | Screening + leases | No booking site, no MTR focus |
| **Us** | MTR end-to-end | ✅ Everything | — |

**Key insight:** Long-term rental tools (Avail, TurboTenant) have screening + leases but no booking site or MTR focus. STR tools have booking sites but no leases or monthly billing. **We bridge both.**

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Prove It (Now → Month 3)
- **Build Chad's own direct booking site** ✅ (done)
- Get real bookings through the direct site
- Document the process, savings, and results
- **Content:** "How I got my first direct MTR booking" blog post / Twitter thread

### Phase 2: First 10 Customers (Month 3-6)
- **Furnished Finder Facebook groups** — these are massive, active communities
- Offer to build 10 sites for free/cheap in exchange for feedback
- **Traveling nurse Facebook groups** — hosts actively share tips here
- **Content marketing:** "MTR Direct Booking Playbook" — free guide, email capture
- **BiggerPockets forums** — MTR-specific threads

### Phase 3: Scale (Month 6-12)
- Launch self-serve site builder (template system)
- Add screening + lease features
- **SEO play:** "furnished rental direct booking," "traveling nurse rental website," "medium term rental tools"
- **Partnerships:** Furnished Finder affiliate? MTR coaching programs? Nurse staffing agencies?
- **Podcast circuit:** BiggerPockets, MTR-specific podcasts, nurse travel podcasts

### Phase 4: Platform (Month 12+)
- Guest directory / verified tenant network
- Pricing intelligence ("What should I charge for a 2BR MTR in Denver?")
- Multi-property dashboard
- API integrations (Furnished Finder, Airbnb calendar sync)

## Moat / Defensibility

1. **Distribution** — first mover in MTR-specific tooling, own the SEO
2. **Network effects** — verified guest directory grows with every host
3. **Data moat** — aggregate MTR pricing + occupancy data across markets
4. **Workflow lock-in** — leases, payment history, guest records all live in the platform
5. **Community** — MTR host community, playbooks, templates, knowledge base
6. **Domain expertise** — Chad is an actual MTR host who built this for himself first

## Tech Stack (Keep It Simple)

- **Frontend:** Static site templates (HTML/CSS/JS) or Next.js
- **Backend:** Node.js or Python
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase for speed)
- **Payments:** Stripe
- **Screening:** API integration (TransUnion SmartMove, Certn, or similar)
- **E-signatures:** DocuSign API or HelloSign
- **Hosting:** Vercel or Railway
- **Auth:** Clerk or Supabase Auth
- **Ads:** Facebook Marketing API
- **Smart Locks:** August / Schlage API
- **Communications:** SendGrid (email) + Twilio (SMS)
- **AI Copy:** OpenAI API for site generation + ad creative

## Chad's Unfair Advantages

1. **He's the customer** — actual MTR host who felt the pain firsthand
2. **Enterprise sales background** (Gartner) — knows how to position, price, and sell
3. **Government/consulting experience** — understands compliance, procurement, trust
4. **Has a live property** — can dogfood everything and show real results
5. **AI-native builder** — can ship fast with AI tools, low burn rate

## Key Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Furnished Finder builds this themselves | Move fast, build community loyalty, offer what FF won't (site builder) |
| Low willingness to pay | Validate with free tier, upsell on screening/leases (clear ROI) |
| Hosts stick with Airbnb | Position as "AND" not "OR" — keep Airbnb, add direct channel |
| Technical complexity of screening/leases | Start with template-only tier, add features incrementally |
| Part-time founder bandwidth | AI-assisted development, simple stack, no premature scaling |

## Immediate Next Steps

1. ✅ Finish Chad's direct booking site (proof of concept)
2. ⬜ Get first direct booking through the site
3. ⬜ Document the experience (content for marketing)
4. ⬜ Set up landing page for the SaaS (waitlist / email capture)
5. ⬜ Post in Furnished Finder Facebook groups for validation
6. ⬜ Build MVP template system (3-5 property site templates)
7. ⬜ Research screening + lease API providers
8. ⬜ Pick a name and buy a domain
