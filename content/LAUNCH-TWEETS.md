## Main Launch Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
I just built the tool I wished existed when I started my MTR business.

Airbnb takes 15-20% of every booking.
On my $4,500/mo rental, that's $675-900/month. Gone.

So I built something different. 🧵
```

### Tweet 2 (Problem)
```
The MTR host dilemma:

Option A: Airbnb
✅ Great automation
❌ 15-20% fees every booking

Option B: Furnished Finder  
✅ No fees
❌ Zero automation, manual everything

Why can't we have both?
```

### Tweet 3 (Solution)
```
Introducing MTR Direct.

Airbnb's automation. Without Airbnb's fees.

→ Direct booking site (AI-generated)
→ Marketing engine (Facebook/IG ads)
→ Tenant screening
→ Lease generation
→ Payment processing
→ Move-in automation

One flat monthly fee. That's it.
```

### Tweet 4 (ROI)
```
The math is simple:

Airbnb: $675-900/month in fees
MTR Direct: $29-149/month flat

You save $500+/month. Every month.

On a single property.
```

### Tweet 5 (Story)
```
I built this because I was tired of giving Airbnb $700/month for automation I could own.

I'm an MTR host in San Antonio. 4.93★ on Airbnb, 167 reviews.

I know what hosts need because I am one.
```

## Standalone Tweets (Post Throughout Launch)

### Pain Point Tweet
```
Airbnb just took another $800 from my monthly rental.

That's $9,600/year. Gone.

There has to be a better way.

(There is. I'm building it.)
```

### Building in Public
```
Day 1 of building MTR Direct:

✅ Landing page live
✅ Waitlist capturing emails
✅ First 10 signups

The market for this is real. Hosts are tired of platform fees.

### Stat Tweet
```
Did you know?

The average MTR host pays $6,000-10,000/year in Airbnb fees.

That's a vacation. A car payment. A property upgrade.

What if you could keep that money?
```

### Question Tweet
```
MTR hosts: What's the #1 thing you hate about Airbnb?

(Besides the fees 😅)

Building something and want to get it right.

## Response Templates

### When someone asks what MTR Direct is:
```
MTR Direct = Airbnb's automation without Airbnb's fees.

Direct booking site, marketing, screening, leases, payments — all automated.

One flat monthly fee. No commission on your bookings.
```

### When someone asks about pricing:
```
$29/mo (1 property)
$79/mo (3 properties)  
$149/mo (unlimited)

Compare that to 15-20% of every booking on Airbnb.

On a $4,500/mo rental, you save $500+/month.
