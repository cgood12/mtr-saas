## Email 1: Welcome (Immediately After Signup)

**Subject:** You're on the MTR Direct waitlist 🏠

**Body:**
```
Hey there,

Welcome to the MTR Direct waitlist. You're officially in line for early access.

Here's what you signed up for:

→ Airbnb's automation without Airbnb's fees
→ Direct booking site, marketing, screening, leases, payments
→ One flat monthly fee (no commission on your bookings)

I'm Chad, the founder. I built this because I was tired of giving Airbnb $700/month in fees on my San Antonio rental.

If you're like me, you know there has to be a better way. There is.

I'll keep you posted as we get closer to launch. In the meantime, reply to this email with your #1 question about MTR Direct — I read every response.

Talk soon,
Chad

P.S. — You've locked in early access pricing. When we launch, your rate stays the same forever.

## Email 2: The Problem (Day 3)

**Subject:** The $9,600/year problem

**Body:**
```
Quick math:

$4,500/month rental
× 15% Airbnb fee
× 12 months
= $8,100/year gone

That's if you're lucky. Some hosts pay 20%.

At 20%, you're losing $10,800/year on a single property.

That's not a platform fee. That's a second mortgage.

Here's the thing: Airbnb's automation is great. Their fees are not.

What if you could keep the automation and ditch the fees?

That's exactly what MTR Direct does.

More details coming soon.

Chad

## Email 3: The Solution (Day 7)

**Subject:** How MTR Direct actually works

**Body:**
```
People keep asking: "How does MTR Direct work?"

Here's the 60-second version:

1. **You upload photos** → We build your direct booking site (AI-generated, looks professional)

2. **You set your ad budget** → We run Facebook/Instagram ads targeted at traveling nurses, corporate relocators, your ideal tenants

3. **Leads come in** → You approve them (or we screen automatically)

4. **Lease + payment** → Generated and processed automatically

5. **Move-in** → Lock codes, welcome guide, all automated

That's it.

You do 3 things: upload photos, set budget, approve guests.

We handle everything else.

One flat monthly fee. $29-149/mo depending on how many properties you have.

No percentage. No commission. No BS.

## Email 4: Social Proof / Story (Day 14)

**Subject:** Why I built this

**Body:**
```
I've been an MTR host for [X] years.

4.93★ on Airbnb. 167 reviews. San Antonio, near The Pearl.

I know what works. I also know what's broken.

Every month, I watched Airbnb take $600-800 from my rental income. For what? Messaging automation I could build myself?

So I did.

MTR Direct started as a tool for my own property. Now it's becoming something bigger.

I'm not a tech company pretending to understand rentals. I'm a host who got tired of the fees and built a solution.

If you're on this waitlist, you probably feel the same way.

We're getting close to launch. I'll have more details soon.

Chad

Pricing reminder:
