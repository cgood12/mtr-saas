## Salary & Housing Economics

### Travel Nurse Pay
- **Average weekly pay:** $2,106 (~$109k/year)
- **Top markets:** $2,800-3,000+/week
- **Tax-free housing stipend:** Up to 40% of total pay

### What This Means for MTR Hosts
- Travel nurses have **budget for quality housing**
- Tax-free stipend = they're motivated to find good deals
- 13-week contracts = perfect MTR length
- Repeat bookings if they return to the same city

### Sample Economics
```
Travel nurse stipend: $1,500-2,000/month (tax-free)
MTR listing: $2,000-3,500/month
Nurse perception: "I'm covered by stipend + a little extra"
Host perception: "Reliable tenant, 3-month minimum, professional"
```

## Housing Pain Points (What Nurses Complain About)

Based on forums, Facebook groups, and reviews:

1. **Can't find listings** — Furnished Finder is crowded
2. **Slow responses** — Hosts don't reply quickly
3. **Scams** — Fake listings are common
4. **Poor quality** — Photos don't match reality
5. **No flexibility** — Rigid lease terms
6. **No reviews** — Can't verify host reputation

**MTR Direct opportunity:** Solve these with verified hosts, fast response automation, quality photos, and trust signals.

## Competitive Landscape for Nurse Housing

### Where Nurses Search
1. **Furnished Finder** — Dominant, 15M annual users
2. **Facebook Groups** — "Travel Nurse Housing" groups
3. **Airbnb** — Expensive for long stays
4. **Craigslist** — Risky, scam-prone
5. **Corporate housing** — CHBO, Blueground

### Gap in Market
No platform helps **hosts** proactively find nurses. It's all pull (nurses search), not push (hosts reach nurses).

MTR Direct's marketing engine could change this.

## Seasonal Patterns

| Season | Demand | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Winter (Dec-Feb) | High | Flu season, holiday coverage |
| Spring (Mar-May) | Moderate | Standard contracts |
| Summer (Jun-Aug) | Lower | Less acute demand |
| Fall (Sep-Nov) | Rising | Pre-winter surge |

**Implication:** Price and marketing should adjust seasonally.

---

## Growth Drivers

1. **Aging population** — More healthcare needs
2. **Nursing shortage** — 200,000 new nurses needed annually
3. **Burnout** — Staff nurses leaving for travel contracts
4. **Hospital staffing gaps** — Can't fill permanent roles
5. **Remote work trend** — More people need temporary housing (not just nurses)

---

## Risks

1. **Market normalization** — Demand down 40% from COVID peak
2. **Pay compression** — Rates dropping, budgets tighter
3. **Burnout** — Fewer nurses entering travel nursing
4. **Competition** — Furnished Finder could add features

---
