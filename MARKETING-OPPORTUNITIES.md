## BiggerPockets Forum Threads (High Intent)

These are active discussions where MTR hosts are asking for exactly what we're building.

### Thread 1: "Whats everyone using for Mid-Term Rental Software"
**URL:** https://www.biggerpockets.com/forums/925/topics/1210248-whats-everyone-using-for-mid-term-rental-software  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Key quote from most popular reply:**
> "There is no software that integrates with Furnished Finder, yet. I heard this directly from their team, it's an issue with the site and it doesn't have the technical capability until they make some significant changes."

> "Either way, you'll need ways to fill the gaps since STR and LTR management apps don't have all the features needed for MTRs. For example, if you use Hospitable, you'll need another solution for background checks, lease signing, and monthly rent collection."

**Opportunity:** Chad can reply (once we launch) with a genuine "I built this exact solution" post.

### Thread 2: "MTR Software in Late 2025"
**URL:** https://www.biggerpockets.com/forums/925/topics/1269583-mtr-software-in-late-2025  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Status:** Active discussion about automation

### Thread 3: "Property management software for both STR and MTR?"
**URL:** https://www.biggerpockets.com/forums/925/topics/1089578-property-management-software-for-both-str-and-mtr  
**Date:** June 2025

### Thread 4: "Best background check and rent collection software for MTRs"
**URL:** https://www.biggerpockets.com/forums/925/topics/1239548-best-background-check-and-rent-collection-software-for-mtrs  
**Date:** July 2025
